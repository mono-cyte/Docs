# About This Manual

The Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's Manual, Volume 1: Basic Architecture (order number 253665) is part of a set that describes the architecture and programming environment of Intel® 64 and IA-32 architecture processors. Other volumes in this set are:

- The Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's Manual, Volumes 2A, 2B, 2C & 2D: Instruction Set Reference (order numbers 253666, 253667, 326018, and 334569).
- The Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's Manual, Volumes 3A, 3B, 3C & 3D: System Programming Guide (order numbers 253668, 253669, 326019, and 332831).
- The Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's Manual, Volume 4: Model-Specific Registers (order number 335592).

The Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's Manual, Volume 1, describes the basic architecture and programming environment of Intel 64 and IA-32 processors.

The Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's Manual, Volumes 2A, 2B, 2C, & 2D, describe the instruction set of the processor and the opcode struc-ture.

These volumes apply to application programmers and to programmers who write operating systems or exec-utives.

The Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's Manual, Volumes 3A, 3B, 3C, & 3D, describe the operating-system support environment of Intel 64 and IA-32 processors. These volumes target operating-system and BIOS designers.

In addition, the Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's Manual, Volume 3B, addresses the programming environment for classes of software that host operating systems.

The Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's Manual, Volume 4, describes the model-specific registers of Intel 64 and IA-32 processors.
