# Basic Execution Environment

This chapter describes the basic execution environment of an Intel 64 or IA-32 processor as seen by assembly-language programmers. It describes how the processor executes instructions and how it stores and manipulates data. The execution environment described here includes memory (the address space), general-purpose data registers, segment registers, the flag register, and the instruction pointer register.
