# Instruction Set Reference, A-L

This chapter describes the instruction set for the Intel 64 and IA-32 architectures (A-L) in IA-32e, protected,
virtual-8086, and real-address modes of operation. The set includes general-purpose, x87 FPU, MMX,
SSE/SSE2/SSE3/SSSE3/SSE4, AESNI/PCLMULQDQ, AVX, and system instructions. See also Chapter 4, “Instruction
Set Reference, M-U,” in the Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 2B;
Chapter 5, “Instruction Set Reference, V,” in the Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual,
Volume 2C; and Chapter 6, “Instruction Set Reference, W-Z,” in the Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software
Developer’s Manual, Volume 2D.
For each instruction, each operand combination is described. A description of the instruction and its operand, an
operational description, a description of the effect of the instructions on flags in the EFLAGS register, and a
summary of exceptions that can be generated are also provided.
