<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-registers_002c-global-allocation"></a>

<p>You can define a global register variable and associate it with a specified 
register like this:
</p>
<div class="example smallexample">
<pre class="example-preformatted">register int *foo asm (&quot;r12&quot;);
</pre></div>

<p>Here <code class="code">r12</code> is the name of the register that should be used. Note that 
this is the same syntax used for defining local register variables, but for 
a global variable the declaration appears outside a function. The 
<code class="code">register</code> keyword is required, and cannot be combined with 
<code class="code">static</code>. The register name must be a valid register name for the
target platform.
</p>
<p>Do not use type qualifiers such as <code class="code">const</code> and <code class="code">volatile</code>, as
the outcome may be contrary to expectations.  In  particular, using the
<code class="code">volatile</code> qualifier does not fully prevent the compiler from
optimizing accesses to the register.
</p>
<p>Registers are a scarce resource on most systems and allowing the 
compiler to manage their usage usually results in the best code. However, 
under special circumstances it can make sense to reserve some globally.
For example this may be useful in programs such as programming language 
interpreters that have a couple of global variables that are accessed 
very often.
</p>
<p>After defining a global register variable, for the current compilation
unit:
</p>
<ul class="itemize mark-bullet">
<li>If the register is a call-saved register, call ABI is affected:
the register will not be restored in function epilogue sequences after
the variable has been assigned.  Therefore, functions cannot safely
return to callers that assume standard ABI.
</li><li>Conversely, if the register is a call-clobbered register, making
calls to functions that use standard ABI may lose contents of the variable.
Such calls may be created by the compiler even if none are evident in
the original program, for example when libgcc functions are used to
make up for unavailable instructions.
</li><li>Accesses to the variable may be optimized as usual and the register
remains available for allocation and use in any computations, provided that
observable values of the variable are not affected.
</li><li>If the variable is referenced in inline assembly, the type of access
must be provided to the compiler via constraints (see <a class="pxref" href="Constraints.html">Constraints for <code class="code">asm</code> Operands</a>).
Accesses from basic asms are not supported.
</li></ul>

<p>Note that these points <em class="emph">only</em> apply to code that is compiled with the
definition. The behavior of code that is merely linked in (for example 
code from libraries) is not affected.
</p>
<p>If you want to recompile source files that do not actually use your global 
register variable so they do not use the specified register for any other 
purpose, you need not actually add the global register declaration to 
their source code. It suffices to specify the compiler option 
<samp class="option">-ffixed-<var class="var">reg</var></samp> (see <a class="pxref" href="Code-Gen-Options.html">Options for Code Generation Conventions</a>) to reserve the 
register.
</p>
<h4 class="subsubheading" id="Declaring-the-variable"><span>Declaring the variable<a class="copiable-link" href="#Declaring-the-variable"> &para;</a></span></h4>

<p>Global register variables cannot have initial values, because an
executable file has no means to supply initial contents for a register.
</p>
<p>When selecting a register, choose one that is normally saved and 
restored by function calls on your machine. This ensures that code
which is unaware of this reservation (such as library routines) will 
restore it before returning.
</p>
<p>On machines with register windows, be sure to choose a global
register that is not affected magically by the function call mechanism.
</p>
<h4 class="subsubheading" id="Using-the-variable"><span>Using the variable<a class="copiable-link" href="#Using-the-variable"> &para;</a></span></h4>

<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-qsort_002c-and-global-register-variables"></a>
<p>When calling routines that are not aware of the reservation, be 
cautious if those routines call back into code which uses them. As an 
example, if you call the system library version of <code class="code">qsort</code>, it may 
clobber your registers during execution, but (if you have selected 
appropriate registers) it will restore them before returning. However 
it will <em class="emph">not</em> restore them before calling <code class="code">qsort</code>&rsquo;s comparison 
function. As a result, global values will not reliably be available to 
the comparison function unless the <code class="code">qsort</code> function itself is rebuilt.
</p>
<p>Similarly, it is not safe to access the global register variables from signal
handlers or from more than one thread of control. Unless you recompile 
them specially for the task at hand, the system library routines may 
temporarily use the register for other things.  Furthermore, since the register
is not reserved exclusively for the variable, accessing it from handlers of
asynchronous signals may observe unrelated temporary values residing in the
register.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-register-variable-after-longjmp"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-global-register-after-longjmp"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-value-after-longjmp"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-longjmp"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-setjmp"></a>
<p>On most machines, <code class="code">longjmp</code> restores to each global register
variable the value it had at the time of the <code class="code">setjmp</code>. On some
machines, however, <code class="code">longjmp</code> does not change the value of global
register variables. To be portable, the function that called <code class="code">setjmp</code>
should make other arrangements to save the values of the global register
variables, and to restore them in a <code class="code">longjmp</code>. This way, the same
thing happens regardless of what <code class="code">longjmp</code> does.
