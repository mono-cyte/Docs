<p>If you want your own collection object to be usable with fast
enumeration, you need to have it implement the method
</p>
<div class="example smallexample">
<pre class="example-preformatted">- (unsigned long) countByEnumeratingWithState: (NSFastEnumerationState *)state
                                      objects: (id *)objects
                                        count: (unsigned long)len;
</pre></div>

<p>where <code class="code">NSFastEnumerationState</code> must be defined in your code as follows:
</p>
<div class="example smallexample">
<pre class="example-preformatted">typedef struct
{
  unsigned long state;
  id            *itemsPtr;
  unsigned long *mutationsPtr;
  unsigned long extra[5];
} NSFastEnumerationState;
</pre></div>

<p>If no <code class="code">NSFastEnumerationState</code> is defined in your code, the
compiler will automatically replace <code class="code">NSFastEnumerationState *</code>
with <code class="code">struct __objcFastEnumerationState *</code>, where that type is
silently defined by the compiler in an identical way.  This can be
confusing and we recommend that you define
<code class="code">NSFastEnumerationState</code> (as shown above) instead.
</p>
<p>The method is called repeatedly during a fast enumeration to retrieve
batches of objects.  Each invocation of the method should retrieve the
next batch of objects.
</p>
<p>The return value of the method is the number of objects in the current
batch; this should not exceed <code class="code">len</code>, which is the maximum size of
a batch as requested by the caller.  The batch itself is returned in
the <code class="code">itemsPtr</code> field of the <code class="code">NSFastEnumerationState</code> struct.
</p>
<p>To help with returning the objects, the <code class="code">objects</code> array is a C
array preallocated by the caller (on the stack) of size <code class="code">len</code>.
In many cases you can put the objects you want to return in that
<code class="code">objects</code> array, then do <code class="code">itemsPtr = objects</code>.  But you
don&rsquo;t have to; if your collection already has the objects to return in
some form of C array, it could return them from there instead.
</p>
<p>The <code class="code">state</code> and <code class="code">extra</code> fields of the
<code class="code">NSFastEnumerationState</code> structure allows your collection object
to keep track of the state of the enumeration.  In a simple array
implementation, <code class="code">state</code> may keep track of the index of the last
object that was returned, and <code class="code">extra</code> may be unused.
</p>
<p>The <code class="code">mutationsPtr</code> field of the <code class="code">NSFastEnumerationState</code> is
used to keep track of mutations.  It should point to a number; before
working on each object, the fast enumeration loop will check that this
number has not changed.  If it has, a mutation has happened and the
fast enumeration will abort.  So, <code class="code">mutationsPtr</code> could be set to
point to some sort of version number of your collection, which is
increased by one every time there is a change (for example when an
object is added or removed).  Or, if you are content with less strict
mutation checks, it could point to the number of objects in your
collection or some other value that can be checked to perform an
approximate check that the collection has not been mutated.
</p>
<p>Finally, note how we declared the <code class="code">len</code> argument and the return
value to be of type <code class="code">unsigned long</code>.  They could also be declared
to be of type <code class="code">unsigned int</code> and everything would still work.
